     <h2>Backend platform for node.js</h2>

<p>General purpose backend framework. The primary goal is to have a scalable platform for running and managing node.js
servers for Web services implementation.
</p>
<p>
This framework only covers the lower portion of the Web services system:
node.js processes, HTTP servers, basic API functinality, database access, caching, messaging between processes,
metrics and monitoring, a library of tools for developing node.js servers.
</p>
<p>
For the UI and presentation layer there are no restrictions what to use as long as it can run on top of the Express server.
</p>
Features:
<ul>
<li> Exposes a set of Web service APIs over HTTP(S) using Express framework.
<li> Database API supports SQLite, DynamoDB, ElasticSearch with all basic operations behaving the
  same way allowing you to switch databases without changing the code.
<li> Database operations (Get, Put, Del, Update, Select) for all supported databases using the same DB API.
<li> Experimental database drivers for PostreSQL, MySQL, Cassandra, Riak, CouchDB
<li> Experimental DynamoDB Streams processing in background worker processes
<li> Easily extensible to support any kind of database, provides a database driver on top of Redis with all supported methods as an example.
<li> Provides accounts, connections, locations, messaging and icons APIs with basic functionality for a quick start.
<li> Supports crontab and queue job processing by separate worker processes.
<li> Authentication is based on signed requests using API key and secret, similar to Amazon AWS signing requests.
<li> Runs web server as separate processes to utilize multiple CPU cores.
<li> Supports WebSockets connections and process them with the same Express routes as HTTP requests
<li> Supports several cache modes(Redis, Memcache, Hazelcast, LRU) for the database operations, multiple hosts support
  in the clients for failover.
<li> Supports several PUB/SUB modes of operations using Redis, RabbitMQ, Hazelcast.
<li> Supports async jobs processing using several work queue implementations on top of SQS, Redis, DB, RabbitMQ, Hazelcast.
<li> ImageMagick as a separate C++ module for in-process image scaling, see bkjs-wand on NPM.
<li> REPL (command line) interface for debugging and looking into server internals.
<li> Supports push notifications for mobile devices, APN and GCM/FCM.
<li> Supports HTTP(S) reverse proxy mode where multiple Web workers are load-balanced by the proxy
  server running in the master process instead of relying on the OS scheduling between processes listening on the same port.
<li> Can be used with any MVC, MVVC or other types of frameworks that work on top of, or with, the Express server.
<li> AWS support is very well integrated including EC2, S3, DynamoDB, SQS and more.
<li> Includes simple log watcher to monitor the log files including system errors.
<li> Supports i18n hooks for request/response objects, easily overriden with any real i18n implementation.
<li> Integrated very light unit testing facility which can be used to test modules and API requests
<li> Supports runtime metrics about the timing on database, requests, cache, memory and request rate limit control
<li>Hosted on [github](https://github.com/vseryakov/backendjs), BSD licensed.
